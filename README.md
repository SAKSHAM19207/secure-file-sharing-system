# Secure File Sharing System using Java

A Java-based secure file sharing system designed using core Computer Science concepts.
The project follows a phased development approach.

## Phase 1 – Core System (Completed)
- User authentication
- Password hashing using SHA-256
- AES-based file encryption and decryption
- Secure file upload and download

## Phase 2 – Access Control (Completed)
- Role-based authorization (Admin / User)
- File ownership tracking
- Activity logging

## Phase 3 – Enhancements (Planned)
- UI integration
- Improved validation
- Performance optimizations

## Technologies
- Java
- Cryptography (AES, SHA-256)
- File Handling
- OOP Principles
