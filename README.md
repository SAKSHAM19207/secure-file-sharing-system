# Secure File Sharing System using Java

This project is a Java-based secure file sharing system designed to store and
share files securely using cryptographic techniques and access control mechanisms.

The system is implemented in phases to reflect incremental development and
feature expansion.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Secure System (Completed)

### Features
- User authentication using username and password
- Password hashing using SHA-256
- Secure file upload with AES encryption
- Encrypted file storage on disk
- Secure file download with decryption on access
- Basic access control for authorized users

### Concepts Used
- Java (Core)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- File Handling
- Java Cryptography API
- Data Structures
- Exception Handling

---

## Phase 2 – Extended Access Control (Planned)
- Role-based access control (Admin / User)
- File ownership tracking
- Activity logging (upload and download history)

---

## Phase 3 – Enhancements (Future Scope)
- Improved error handling and validation
- User interface integration
- Performance and security optimizations

---

## Purpose
This project was developed to strengthen core Computer Science concepts such as
security, system design, and file handling, with a focus on clean logic and
modular architecture.
